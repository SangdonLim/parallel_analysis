This branch `validate_noise_size` contains materials for an updated version of the simulation, where the generation logic for population correlation matrices was updated to satisfy the condition:

- `k` denotes the true number of factors
- `lambda_k` denotes the `k`-th eigenvalue of the main correlation matrix (without raising the diagonals to ones)
- `lambda_e` denotes the first eigenvalue of the weighted noise matrix (without raising the diagonals to ones)
- condition: `lambda_k >= lambda_e` must hold

The main goal of this update was to address one of the arguments presented by Achim (2021):

**Please do not cite the contents of this branch.** The updated dataset has not been used in any published article; the updates to the simulation script and results have not been peer reviewed.
